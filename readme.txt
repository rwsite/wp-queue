= Usage =

**Creating a Job:**

`
use WPQueue\Jobs\Job;
use WPQueue\Attributes\Queue;
use WPQueue\Attributes\Retries;

#[Queue('emails')]
#[Retries(3)]
class SendEmailJob extends Job
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly string $email
    ) {
        parent::__construct();
    }

    public function handle(): void
    {
        wp_mail($this->email, 'Subject', 'Body');
    }
}
`

**Dispatching:**

`
use WPQueue\WPQueue;

// Dispatch to queue
WPQueue::dispatch(new SendEmailJob('user@example.com'));

// Dispatch with delay
WPQueue::dispatch(new SendEmailJob('user@example.com'))
    ->delay(300); // 5 minutes
`

= WP-CLI Commands =

`
# Queue commands
wp queue status              # Show queue status
wp queue work [queue]        # Process jobs from queue
wp queue clear [queue]       # Clear all jobs from queue
wp queue failed              # List failed jobs

# Cron commands
wp queue cron list           # List all cron events
wp queue cron run <hook>     # Run a cron event now
wp queue cron delete <hook>  # Delete a cron event
wp queue cron pause <hook>   # Pause a cron event
wp queue cron resume <hook>  # Resume a paused event

# System commands
wp queue system              # Show system status
`

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/wp-queue`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Access the dashboard via WP Admin → WP Queue

**Via Composer:**

`
composer require rwsite/wp-queue
`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What PHP version is required? =

PHP 8.3 or higher is required for PHP 8 attributes support.

= How does it compare to Action Scheduler? =

WP Queue is lighter and uses modern PHP features. Action Scheduler is more mature and has WooCommerce integration. Choose based on your needs.

= Can I use Redis as a queue driver? =

Yes! Redis is supported out of the box. Add to wp-config.php:

`
define('WP_QUEUE_DRIVER', 'redis');
define('WP_REDIS_HOST', '127.0.0.1');
define('WP_REDIS_PORT', 6379);
`

If you use the Redis Object Cache plugin, WP Queue will automatically use the same settings.

= What queue drivers are available? =

* **database** - Uses wp_options table (default)
* **redis** - Redis server (requires phpredis extension)
* **memcached** - Memcached server (requires memcached extension)
* **sync** - Synchronous execution (no queue)
* **auto** - Automatically selects best available driver

= Is it compatible with multisite? =

Yes, WP Queue works with WordPress multisite installations.
